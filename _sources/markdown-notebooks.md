# Notebooks with MyST Markdown

Jupyter Book also lets you write text-based notebooks using MyST Markdown.
See [the Notebooks with MyST Markdown documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/myst-notebooks.html) for more detailed instructions.
This page shows off a notebook written in MyST Markdown.

## An example cell

With MyST Markdown

```{code-cell}
print(2 + 2)
```

When your book is built, the contents of any `{code-cell}` blocks will be
executed with your default Jupyter kernel, and their outputs will be displayed
in-line with the rest of your content.

```{seealso}
Jupyter Book uses [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to convert text-based files to notebooks, and can support [many other text-based notebook files](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/jupytext.html).
