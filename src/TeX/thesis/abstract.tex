In this thesis project I, we present the mathematical formulation of
the linear \emph{advection-difussion} partial differential equation.
This base model allows studying the kinetics of systems of chemical
reactions and the transport of contaminants in meteorological
phenomena.
Our study begins with the presentation of the differential and
integral forms of conservation law and the deduction of the
one-dimensional advection-difussion equation.
We introduce first and second order discretization schemes for space
and time.
The consistency and stability of the main methods are studied.
Finally, the convergence results in the numerical tests subjected to
the schemes shown are discussed.
