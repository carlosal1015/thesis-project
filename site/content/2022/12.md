# Arch Linux in December 2022

## The wiki went dark ðŸŒ—

Thanks to the [effort of Blake Wilson][0] in [completing the process][1]
[previously attempted][2] by killertofus to add [Extension:DarkMode][3], it's
lights out for ArchWiki!

All you creatures of the dark can now click on "Dark mode" in the user menu to
experience the soothing darkness. The preference is stored in the database, so
it is only remembered for logged-in users and sadly there is no
`prefers-color-scheme` support. Persistent people can probably find some ways
to append a `usedarkmode=1` query parameter to wiki URLs.

## Decommission patchwork

We have decommissioned patchwork.archlinux.org and replaced it with a static
copy. As [announced on the mailing list][4] pacman has been migrated to gitlab
and there is no real use for patchwork left. A [static copy][5] is kept around for
the time being to avoid link rot.

## Debug packages by default

We have enabled the debug package option globally in [devtools][6]. Any
subsequently built packages will package debug symbols by default. Currently
the debug packages are only exposed via debuginfod and will be exposed to our
mirrors in the future.

## Git packaging sources

A huge amount of time has went into the [ongoing development][7] and iteration
of the new `pkgctl` tooling. We are currently focusing on stability and a
fluent user experience. Some work has been started to be able to provide a
proof of concept environment in January.

## The state of ruby

After a few month of trying to de-vendor the ruby 3.0 stdlib gems we have
decided to stop the effort as we ran into more problems and ruby itself highly
recommends to not do this. This also means that with the de-vendored setup we
would get no support from upstream for any issues we have with the ruby
interpreter.

We have now started to update ruby to 3.1 and will proceed afterwards with 3.2.
