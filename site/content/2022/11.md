# Arch Linux in November 2022

## Git packaging sources

We made huge progress towards finally being able to migrate from SVN to Git for
package sources. The core projects responsible for our package build, workflow
and release, namely [dbscripts][0] and [devtools][1] reached production grade
adjustments to achieve the transition.

Furthermore we have started to document and outline our [Roadmap][2] with the
Git packaging as its first item. This Epic can be followed to outline the full
dependencies including child issues and child epics for everything that needs
to be handled or adjusted afterwards.

The next stop in this journey will be to propose the migration with all
workflow details to arch-dev-public in the following days.

## infrastructure

We have [migrated our Keycloak][3] 17 instance to the recommended [Quarkus
distribution][4] which removes the /auth from the context-path. This change
required all OAuth clients to be adjusted. Furthermore we are now monitoring
our Keycloak intance with [UptimeRobot][5].

## arch-install-scripts

A new version v28 has been [released][6] which mostly contains bugfixes.

## mkinitcpio

Development has moved to the [Arch Linux GitLab][7] instance. A new version v33
has been [released][8] with a lot of improvements. Furthermore the existing
test suite has been heavily extended and migrated to bash bats.

## keyringctl

We have started splitting out the [keyringctl][9] python code from our
archlinux-keyring repository so we can independently develop and release the
tooling.

Furthermore we have started testing and will soon integrate a streamlined way
to create new main key signatures including automatic uid verifications.

## archlinux-keyring

We have [replaced][10] one of our [main signing key][11] as follows:

- added: 69E6 471E 3AE0 6529 7529  832E 6BA0 F5A2 037F 4F41
  demize@master-key.archlinux.org
- revoked: 159F 3A43 AEB2 46C5 746C  0338 14BC 4F30 B3B9 2EBA
  grazzolini@master-key.archlinux.org

## pacman

Some time ago it was decided to [migrate the pacman development][12] from the
Mailing List to the Gitlab instance hosted by Arch Linux. We have now [outlined
a plan][13] for the next steps to finally complete the GitLab migration.

## repod

A [talk][14] about the current state of things will be held during [HIP][15] between
27th - 30th December 2022: "Pacman can have the cookies and eat the ghosts too".

## RFC

We are formalizing an [RFC][16] to declare SPDX license identifiers in
PKGBUILDs. SPDX, or Software Package Data Exchange, was formed by the Linux
Foundation as a well-defined standard for software bill of material
information.

## Staff

We would like to [welcome tpkessler among the Arch Linux Package
Maintainers][17].
