# Arch Linux in May 2022

## Staff

We would like to [welcome Slithery][0] among our Forum Admins.

Furthermore [fukawi2 has stepping down][1] as Forum Admin. We would like
to express appreciation for all the work through the years.

Last but not least we held our first Mediator election where Andrea
Denisse Gómez-Martínez (denisse), David Runge (dvzrv) and Morgan Adamiec
(morganamilo) were elected. This has implemented the previously ratified
[RFC-0009][2]. An official mediation program in our organization helps to
settle disputes and provides a clear escalation path.

## gnome boxes

Gnome boxes now supports installing Arch Linux from an ISO using our
GeoIP mirror.

## mailman3

We started migrating our mailing lists from mailman2 to mailman3. The
migration is handled list by list by DevOps.

All mailman3 lists will have their From header kept unmangled,
preserving the sent mail as is hence allowing to validate DKIM
signatures.
