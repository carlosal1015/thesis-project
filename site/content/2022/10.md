# Arch Linux in October 2022

## mkinitcpio

mkinitcpio `v32` has been [released][0] which adds support for zst
compressed firmware for future kernel versions as well as various fixes
and adjustments.

## pacman

pacman `6.0.2` has been [released][1] which fixes multiple issues with
debug packages. On top pacman-key has been adjusted to do a single gpg
trustdb check instead of one after each key revocation. Furthermore
various fixes have been added related to clang lto, reproducible
packages containing sparse files and other fixes.

## python-bootstrap

To build python-setuptools for Python 3.11 one needs python-setuptools.
The same bootstrapping issue exists for other Python packages, which
provide (PEP517) build backends and are required for building the
remaining ecosystem from scratch.

In the future we want to rely on [python-bootstrap][2] to allow us to
transparently bootstrap the Python ecosystem on a new release and
document the workflow. Not all initially required packages are defined
yet, but a first attempt at bootstrapping has been [completed][3].

## OpenSSL 3

The OpenSSL 3 rebuild started with the latest version `3.0.7` which will
hopefully land soon in the `[testing]` repository.
