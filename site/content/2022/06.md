# Arch Linux in June 2022

## devtools

The new devtools release brings in [several new additions][0]. First and
foremost the `export-pkgbuild-keys` script in combination with
`commitpkg` ensures we export all validpgpkeys into the source tree. The
local keys cache will allow us to operate without remote PGP keyservers
for the most part.

Furthermore the [new diffpkg tool][1] allows to automatically diff a
package file against the current repository version or another package
file. Multiple diff modes allow comparing archive listings, the whole
content via diffoscope or the `.PKGINFO` and `.BUILDINFO` metadata.

Last but not least we have [added][2] `x86_64_v3` builders as a first step
towards more optimized architectures. The scripts and configs can be
used for testing purposes.

## archlinux.page

In cooperation with SPI and Gandi a new [archlinux.page][3] domain has been
acquired to host the documentation of projects related to Arch Linux.

First deployments are already available on the following subdomains:

- <https://repod.archlinux.page/>
- <https://monthly-reports.archlinux.page/>

## archiso

The official installation ISO image can now [boot on IA32 UEFI][4].

## SPI

The annual SPI report for member projects updates has been submitted and
will be available shortly through SPI.

## glibc

The glibc package ships with the `C.UTF-8` locale available by default.
