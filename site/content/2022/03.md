# Arch Linux in March 2022

## Staff

We would like to welcome [sudoforge][0] among the Trusted Users.

## RFC

We have ratified a [RFC][1] to store upstream signing keys alongside the packaging
sources. This will allow easier successive builds without the need to
continuously rely on remote keyservers to retrieve the upstream signing keys.

## security-tracker

After a lot of work and with the amazing help of multiple people we have
finally finished the [SSO integration][2] of our security tracker. This is
one step closer to a uniform authentication and role management across our
[services][3].

Furthermore several incompatibility changes have been resolved which finally
allowed us to upgrade to SQLAlchemy `1.4`.
