# Arch Linux in July 2022

## archlinux-keyring

The archlinux-keyring package gained a [systemd service and timer unit][0]
which updates existing PGP keys used by pacman on user systems by default on a
weekly basis from Arch Linux's web key directory (WKD).  This service is meant
to remove the necessity for most cases of "first upgrade your archlinux-keyring
and then do a system upgrade" until pacman itself will be able to deal with
this scenario natively.

A new main signing key `75BD80E4D834509F6E740257B1B73B02CC52A02A` was added to
the keyring. Efforts to sign all active packager keys with it are ongoing,
currently around 85% of the existing keys have been signed already.

## pacman

Extend --print-format with all expac format strings which can be easily added
without conversions and through a simple C macro.

## Wiki

After [almost three years][1], the Lockdown extension is finally disabled and
the recent changes page, page history and others are once again visible without
having to log in.

## repod

A first release has been made, which supports rudimentary validation,
inspection of package files and is available in the official repositories (see
[this blog post][2] for an overview).

Help with the development of the project would be much appreciated.
