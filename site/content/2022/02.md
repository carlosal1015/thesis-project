# Arch Linux in February 2022

## Staff

[sudoforge][0] has applied to become a Trusted User and the vote is
currently in progress.

On top we would like to welcome freswa and Foxboron to their new
additional duties as Arch Linux Developers.

Furthermore we have onboarded the project maintainers Torxed
(archinstall) and kevr (aurweb) as Arch Linux support staff.

Last but not least we held our bi-yearly Arch Linux Project Leader
election where [Levente Poly√°k was re-elected][1]. Further details about
future plans, priorities and discussed topics will be posted to our
arch-dev-public mailinglist.

## Aurweb

With the `v6.0.0` [release][2], aurweb now runs on Python using the
Starlette/FastAPI framework. A complete list of changes from `v6.0.0` up
to the current patch (v6.0.6) can be [viewed at GitLab][3].

Regarding there have been some modifications to the RPC API endpoints
which have broken some clients in AUR helpers.

## Toolchain

A new toolchain has been released to our stable repositories including
gcc `11.2.0`, binutils `2.38` and glibc `2.35`. Frederik has joined forces
with Giancarlo as an additional toolchain maintainer and helps to reduce
the workload.

## archlinux-keyring

Giancarlo Razzolini has been added as a [new main key holder][4] and will
provide trust to our packaging keys by verifying and signing them.
