# Arch Linux in April 2022

## Keyring

We have started phasing out sha1 keyring signatures and replace some existing
keys with more modern variants.

Furthermore we have started to enforce `@archlinux.org` UIDs so we can
control the retrieval via wkd in a single place and also allow externals
to just trust one official wkd domain.

## Security Team

We would like to welcome djerun and raa who will help us in the security
team to keep track of all vulnerabilities.

## Wiki

We would like to [welcome Erus Iluvatar][0] as an ArchWiki Maintainer and
Translator.

## Infrastructure

We now have a GeoIP based mirror [geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com][1] for docker images
and arch-boxes. After a [MR lands in osinfo-db][2] this will allow users on all
distro's with an update osinfo-db to use gnome-boxes to install Arch Linux with
the "download operating system" option.
