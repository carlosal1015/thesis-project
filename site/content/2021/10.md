# Arch Linux in October 2021

## Devtools

A new devtools release is being [prepared][0] with it's most notable changes:

* Now licensed to GPLv3
* devtools now records the used BUILDTOOL / BUILDTOOLVER in BUILDINFO, this is
  required for when we need to reproduce an old package which was build with a
  different devtools version then the current. (And devtools changed the
  CFLAGS, etc.)
* makerepropkg now supports reading BUILDTOOL / BUILDTOOLVER from a BUILDINFO
  file and use the makepkg.conf from the correct devtools version.
* pacman's makepkg.conf is synced with new hardening CFLAGS such as
  `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -Wformat -Werror=format-security
  -fstack-clash-protection -fcf-protection`
* More missing man pages have been added for archbuild, makechrootpkg,
  arch-nspawn.

## DBScripts

There has been great progress on debug support for [dbscripts][1], review and
testing is very much appreciated.

Dbscripts was moved to Gitlab with Gitlab CI coverage integration.

## Keyring

The archlinux-keyring project gained new tooling called [keyringctl][2] to more
easily handle the distribution's chain of trust, identify problems with
packager keys and allow for a git-based workflow around addition, signing and
revocation of packager and main signing keys. The keyring will become a curated
source of truth and removes dependency on remote keyservers.

archlinux-keyring is now also moved to Gitlab with Gitlab CI coverage integration.

## aurweb

Aurweb is being rewritten in Python using FastAPI, an [announcement][3] has
been posted that the new port can be tested on [aur-dev.archlinux.org][4]

The AUR now provides metadata archives of all AUR packages, to offload requests
from the AUR RPC interface.

[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages-meta-v1.json.gz][5]
[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages-meta-ext-v1.json.gz][6]

For more information see the post on [aur-general][7].

## Arch Linux website

A [MR][8] has been made to make our navbar responsive and in the future archweb
(archlinux.org) responsive in this [PR][9]. Moving to SASS also makes it easier
to get a working dark mode.

Additionally a new archweb release should have a feature to add a [note][10] to
a package to show why it's outdated.

## releng

The monthly release artifacts (i.e. installation medium, bootstrap image, iPXE
images) can now be built in GitLab CI and are released automatically on a
monthly basis in the [releng][11] project.

To further automate the release process on the main repository server,
[arch-release-promotion][12] is about to be tested for the promotion and
synchronization of release artifacts in the relevant projects (i.e. releng or
arch-boxes). This will enable for a streamlined and automated update of the
Arch Linux website with new release information.

A related ticket tracks the work on [restructuring the output directory][13] to
offer a unified approach to non-package releases on the main repository server
in the future.
