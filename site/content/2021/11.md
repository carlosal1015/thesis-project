# Arch Linux in November 2021

## Staff

We are happy to welcome [artafinde][0] among the Trusted Users. Additionally
Segaja has [applied][1] to become a Trusted User and the vote is currently in
progress.

## mkinitcpio

A new mkinitcpio version v31 has been [released][2]. Besides various nice
improvements the biggest highligh of this release is support for [efi stub
generation][3].

There is also a new wiki page for [Unified kernel images][4].

## Keyring

The new keyringctl tooling has been finalized and merged. The next steps are to
convert the keyring data using the new tooling to a curated source of truth.

Additionally we have started to replace packager keys that were not meeting our
latest [strength requirements][5] and to ensure that each key has a dedicated
`@archlinux.org` UID. The goal is that for packaging purpose we only sign
`@archlinux.org` UIDs with the main keys but still allow web-of-trust cross-sigs
issued from packager keys.

## Devtools

A new devtools version `20211129` has been [released][6]. The new devtools
package is waiting in `[staging]` for the python 3.10 rebuild to finish in order
to avoid additional hassle with an already cumbersome rebuild.

LTO has additionally been enabled is this release as the issues should be easy
to spot and extremely simple to work around by just setting an `options` knob
inside the `PKGBUILD`.

Once devtools has been moved out of `[testing]`, a wide ranged rebuild is planned
to make use of the new flags on a broad scale.

## Python

The process to upgrade to Python 3.10 has started and we are currently
[rebuilding][7] all Python packages.

Packagers are also actively working on removing Python 2 from the repositories.
Packages used for development, like python2-virtualenv and python2-pip, was
[recently removed][8] and there is work under way to clear out rest of the
python2 packages.

## archinstall

A new archinstall version `2.3.0` has been [released][9] with a lot of new
functionality and improvements. Most notably it contains:

* GRUB and Disk Encryption now properly works and supports multiple encrypted
  volumes.
* BTRFS subvolumes (beta only supports a [nested structure][10] and has some
  [known issues][11])
* A rudimentary [plugin-support][12], allowing users to create their own plugins.
* [swap][13] has been added into the mix using [zram][14] and [zram-generator][15].

## Reproducible Builds

A new rebuilderd version has been released that supports build groups, meaning
it's now possible to have one build reproduce multiple artifacts at once. This
aids being able to check split packages more efficiently instead of building
the whole group multiple times for every single split artifact.

archlinux-repro has also had a [new release][16] which fixed some bugs.
