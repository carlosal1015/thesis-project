# Arch Linux in January 2023

## Git packaging sources

We have announced the state of the art of the Git packaging migration to
[arch-dev-public][0] including a first item on our distro roadmap to [track the
remaining effort][1].

We have prepared most of the necessary settings, configurations and the
corresponding machine for the new test environment for the Git package
workflow. The test phase is expected to start at the beginning of February.

## base-devel

We have [implemented][2] the `base-devel` and `multilib-devel` meta-package
orthogonal to our already existing `base` meta-package. This change may require
[manual intervention][3]. Lately we added `debugedit` to `base-devel` in order to
provide debug packages via makepkg.  This lead to a couple of followup issues
with installations missing the new package as changes in a package group are
not automatically reflected on system upgrades.

## RFC

We are [formalizing an RFC][4] to increase `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` level to 3 in our
default build flags. For a long time, we have been using `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`
to detect C memory management problems at build time.  Recently, glibc (2.34)
added `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3` to add extra checking. This has been supported in
clang for some time, and is now available in GCC with the release of version
`12`. The gains are enhanced buffer size detection and better fortification
coverage.

## Staff

We would like to [welcome Robin Candau (Antiz) among the Arch Linux Package
Maintainers][5].

Due to extended inactivity, [Kyle Keen (keenerd) has been removed from the Arch
Linux Package Maintainers][6]. We would like to express our gratitude to Kyle
for many years of packaging work.
