# Arch Linux in August 2023

## Staff

We would like to welcome Tomaz Canabrava (tcanabrava) as part of the Arch Linux
Package Maintainer team.

## AURWeb

In [AURWeb v6.2.7][0], we primarily focused on bug fixes while revamping
Prometheus metrics. We introduced new measures like request tracking and
cache-hit/miss ratios for search queries, enhancing our ability to make
development decisions and aiding the AUR moderation team in identifying trends.

Collaborating with the DevOps team, we introduced a CI/CD feature called
[Review Apps][1]. This feature enables us to create virtual machines running
AURWeb for each merge request, facilitating change showcases, manual testing,
and involving a wider audience for performance, stress-testing, and UI
verification.

## RFC

We [proposed and accepted an RFC][2] to define the default of not using `PyPI`
for Python package sources and only use the platform if there is no other
alternative. You can find more details about [this RFC][2] on GitLab. By
making this change, we ensure to have a more reliable and less cumbersome
default.

## Trademark Policy

We've [relocated our Trademark Policy][3] from the Developer area of the
ArchWiki to the [service-agreements GitLab repository][4], which is published
at [`terms.archlinux.org`][5]. This move centralizes all legal documents,
ensuring consistent collaboration across our service agreement materials.
